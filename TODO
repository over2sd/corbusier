Add a mode for generating map using points of interest instead of branching from central point (POI mode)
Add a mode for generating map using crystal growth scheme (crystal mode)
Add an option for branchmap to generate a ring for town center instead of a group of random points (sub ringSquares)
Let a list of exit vertices be passed to genmap/branchmap so that maps can be generated in sections and connect to each other.
