Add a mode for generating map using points of interest instead of branching from central point (POI mode)
Add a mode for generating map using crystal growth scheme (crystal mode)
Add an option for branchmap to generate a ring for town center instead of a group of random points (sub ringSquares)
Let a list of exit vertices be passed to genmap/branchmap so that maps can be generated in sections and connect to each other.
branchSides using addSideHere should check if its origin point is actually on the line. That's why I made the improved intersection functions, though I'd forgotten it by the time I finished...
Add a function that will generate the central squares, since what I have now doesn't seem to produce squares that are always connected.
??? If making a starry ring center and #waypoints=#squares, set base and range narrowly, halfway between azimuths?
twist() should have a switch allowing it to store each segment's parent and children, so that operations dealing with the whole route can collect them together.
