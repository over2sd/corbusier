Add a mode for generating map using points of interest instead of branching from central point (POI mode)
Add a mode for generating map using crystal growth scheme (crystal mode)
Add an option for branchmap to generate a ring for town center instead of a group of random points (sub ringSquares)
Let a list of exit vertices be passed to genmap/branchmap so that maps can be generated in sections and connect to each other.
branchSides using addSideHere should check if its origin point is actually on the line. That's why I made the improved intersection functions, though I'd forgotten it by the time I finished...
Add a function that will generate the central squares, since what I have now doesn't seem to produce squares that are always connected.
??? If making a starry ring center and #waypoints=#squares, set base and range narrowly, halfway between azimuths?
twist() should have a switch allowing it to store each segment's parent and children, so that operations dealing with the whole route can collect them together.
Segment should not store endpoints but reference vertices, so moving one Vertex will move all lines ending on it
generating squares should use point by azimuth, divide circle into joins sections, then add azimuth rand(0,360/joins+1)
